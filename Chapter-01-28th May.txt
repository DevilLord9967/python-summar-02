What is python?
	-> Python is open source (free) progaraming language 
	-> Python is plateform independent (works on all operating system)
	-> Python is interpreter based language(line by line execution of code)
	-> Python is indentation based langauage  
	-> Python is light weight and less syntaxical 


Python Environment 
===========================
Version :
	3.7		* latest 
	3.6		* stable 
	3.5
	..
	..
	2.7
	
Editor:
	Python Shell/Command Line 
		>>>
	Python IDLE
		python script/code/statement should be saved with .py extension 

	Other Editor:
		-Jupyter 
		-VSCode
		-Pycharm
		-Eclipse 
		etc.
		
		
Programing Basics
=======================
	#	Single line comment
	'''	multiple line comment
	'''
	"""	multiple line comment
	"""

	''	string
	""	string 
	[]	list
	()	tuple , function
	{}	dict, set 
	:	block of statement which can use with if condition, loop ,function, 			class, try except etc.

	Note :
		Python does allocate memory automatically
		a =11 #int
		a ='ff' #str
Data Type 
===============
int		a =44	
float		a =54.5
str		a ='ff' or a ="ssh"
bool		a = True / False
list		l = [11,22,3]
tuple		t = (11,22,4)
dict		d ={1:'one','a':'alpha'}
set		s ={'iphone','dove','iphone'}



There are following functions:
	type(data/var)	#return data type
	input('msg')  #read data from console , default type is string
	print(msg/var) #print / show to user to console 
	  


Loop : is iterator or repeation of interations
=======================
Types of loop:
	i. while loop
	ii. for loop
